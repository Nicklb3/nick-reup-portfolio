As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

This portfolio consists of a single-page application with a header, content section, and footer. The header contains the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. The titles are About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

When the portfolio loads, the About Me title and section are selected by default. The About Me section contains a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. The Portfolio section contains titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

The Contact section has a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When the cursor moves out of one of the form fields without entering text, a notification appears that the field is required. If an invalid email address is entered, a notification appears.

The Resume section contains a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies. The footer contains text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform such as Stack Overflow or Twitter.

This portfolio demonstrates the developer's experience building single-page applications with React, and showcases their proficiency in various technologies.
